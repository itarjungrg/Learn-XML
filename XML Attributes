XML elements can have attributes, just like HTML.

Attributes are designed to contain data related to a specific element.

XML Attributes Must be Quoted
Attribute values must always be quoted. Either single or double quotes can be used.

For a person's gender, the <person> element can be written like this:
<person gender="female">

or like this:
<person gender='female'>
